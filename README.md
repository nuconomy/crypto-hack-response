## My seed phrase has been compromised. What should I do?

- They have access to EVERYTHING, you need to move all assets to a safe wallet.
- Act fast, but remain cautious. 
- Create a new wallet (preferably on a new device in case you have a virus) and transfer all assets ASAP.
- Token and NFT transfers require ETH, so you may want to leave a small amount in while you race to remove Tokens and NFTs out to a safe wallet. Warning: This ETH may get stolen and they may use it to transfer assets too. 
- You might consider removing the ETH instead so that they can't make any transactions but it is possible they add their own ETH to do this if your assets are valuable enough. 

## I signed something with MetaMask and people are stealing my NFTs

- You have likely approved token transactions by a third party. Revoke any approvals ASAP. One popular service for doing this is [revoke.cash](revoke.cash) Alternatively, you can try the Etherscan Token Approval checker which is currently in beta: https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker
- You can disconnect your MetaMask from the site but it likely won't prevent any authorisations you have already given.
